# 3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we
# define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

# 21
# which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

# For problems such as these, do not include input statements or define variables we will provide for you. Our automating testing will
# provide values so write your code in the following box assuming these variables are already defined.


None

total = 0
i = 0
while i <= end:
    total += i
    i += 1

print(total)

# Correct
