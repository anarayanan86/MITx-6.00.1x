# Exercise: power recur

# (5/5 points)
# ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 7 minutes

# In Problem 1, we computed an exponential by iteratively executing successive multiplications. We can use the same idea, but in a
# recursive function.

# Write a function recurPower(base, exp) which computes baseexp by recursively calling itself to solve a smaller version of the same
# problem, and then multiplying the result by base to solve the initial problem.

# This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer; exp will be an integer ≥0. It should return one numerical
# value. Your code must be recursive - use of the ** operator or looping constructs is not allowed.


def recurPower(base, exp):
    '''
    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0

    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    # Your code here
    if exp == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return base * recurPower(base, exp - 1)
    
# Correct
